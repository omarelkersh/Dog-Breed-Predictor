# Dog Breed Prediction App

This repository contains code for a simple web application that predicts the breed of a dog based on an uploaded image. The application is built using Streamlit and utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model for dog breed classification.

## Installation

Before running the application, make sure to install the required libraries.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dog-breed-prediction-app.git
cd dog-breed-prediction-app
```

Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501.

Upload an image of a dog using the provided file uploader.

Click the "Predict" button to get the predicted dog breed.

Model
The application uses a pre-trained deep learning model for dog breed classification. The model is loaded using Keras and has been trained on a dataset containing images of different dog breeds.

Classes
The model predicts the dog breed from a set of predefined classes. 

Notes
Ensure that you have a compatible image file (e.g., PNG) to upload.
The model may have limitations and may not accurately predict the breed for all images.
Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the application for your specific use case. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Happy dog breed predicting! üêæ
